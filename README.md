# MARIE-Assembly

This repository consists of a project with basic development work I completed for CSC-205: Computer Organization at NVCC Manassas, 
under the direction of Dr. Annie Hui. 

The code was written in MARIE ('Machine Architecture that is Really Intuitive and Easy') Assembly, an education purpose "language", 
that teaches the von Neumann architecture and how it works. The educational purpose simulator program (MarieSim.jar) was developed in Java 
by Linda Null and Julia Lobur for their textbook, "The Essentials of Computer Organization and Architecture" to teach the foundations of assembly language.

Some resources to understand MARIE, its ISA and RTLs can be found at these webpages:
